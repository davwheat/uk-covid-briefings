### 119 testing hotline

The UK government set up a nationwide testing hotline, accessible by dialling `119`.

This hotline connected you to an agent who is capable of helping you find out if you need a test, ordering a test, and more.

The start of any phone call contains a series of automated messages, which you can listen to [here](./example%20call%20made%20to%20119.mp3)

### Test results

The UK coronavirus testing programme provides automated email and text notifications when a person's test results are available.

You can see the email which I received after testing positive on 12/11/2020 [here](./positive-test-result-email.png).

Please note that the date of testing is when the person claimed their sample was taken, not the date the sample was received by the lab, or when the results were received.

In my case, I took the sample on 12/11/2020, posted it on 13/11/2020, and received results on 15/11/2020.

#### COVID-19 app

The NHS COVID-19 app also provides a link to order free testing kits, which is what I used.

When you order via the app, it automatically tracks your results and notifies you in the app of the result. This allows for the app to share your unique ID, if you test positive, for contact tracing purposes.

# UK Coronavirus Timeline and Videos <!-- omit in toc -->

This repository aims to be a full collection of all coronavirus press briefings and data briefings from the UK Government.

As with all information, you should back this up with information from other sources and not use this alone. This data is compiled and verified by a single person, so mistakes may slip through the net.

## Contents <!-- omit in toc -->

- [Organisation](#organisation)
  - [Monthly READMEs](#monthly-readmes)
- [Coronavirus briefings](#coronavirus-briefings)
  - [Data source](#data-source)
  - [Video modifications](#video-modifications)
- [Coronavirus timeline](#coronavirus-timeline)

## Organisation

This repository is structured with folders for each month of the year(s). Inside those folders is a single text file (`README.md`) as well as the content for that month.

### Monthly READMEs

The README file will contain:

- a list of that folder's contents
- a summary of each video (main points, etc)
- a link to that month's section in the [COVID Timeline](TIMELINE.md)

## Coronavirus briefings

This repo contains a collection of all coronavirus video briefings, addresses, and data briefings. There are no modifications made to the content of these videos except for those listed below.

### Data source

These videos are sourced from the official 10 Downing Street YouTube channel. Some videos have cut out mid-way through, but this is what happened on the official live stream.

If you notice any issue with a video, please open an issue and I will look into alternate sources for the briefing.

**If a video has been sourced from elsewhere, it will be made clear in the README in its folder.**

### Video modifications

All meaningful video content has been left unedited for historic preservation.

There have been some modifications:

- videos have been compressed to fit under GitHub's 100 MiB file size limit 
- static intro and outro cards have been trimmed out (this can often account for over 20 mins of some raw videos, and is purely a waste of file size)

## Coronavirus timeline

This repo also contains a timeline of most large-scale changes in Coronavirus response and announcements.

See [TIMELINE.md](TIMELINE.md).
